# Huacos

A project that uses the fastai V1 library to do  multi-class image recognition.  

The application here to is to be able to recognize images of Peruvian property and to determine the cultural group/civilization that it came from. 

Potter from these civilizations are identified by the model:

* Mochica
* Chimu
* Nazca

The following will be added later once I get a good collection of images for them

* Chavin
* Paracas
* Tiahuanaco
* Inca

## Dependencies

* Fastai library Version 1.x. Installing this will install most of the dependencies.
* See the file `environment.yml` for the dependencis in a `conda` environment
